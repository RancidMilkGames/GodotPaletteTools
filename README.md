# Godot 4 Palette Tools

This is a small add-on that allows easy editing of palettes for Godot 4's built in swatch system.
Instead of manually having to set each color for the editor color swatches, you can use this plugin 
to quickly load in palettes via URL(currently works with Lospec), or you can make your own and save 
it for easy switching later.

# Instructions

Copy either the entire “addons” folder or the folder inside the “addons” folder from this project
into your own.

# Notes

Tested on Godot 4 (beta 14)
Palette tools will appear in the same dock as the inspector/node/history docks. (Top right corner)
