# Godot 4 Palette Tools

This is a small addon that allows for easy color palette integration in Godot 4. Quickly Create/Download
palettes. Load/Save for use any time. Comes with the ability to quickly switch the editor's color-picker
swatches as well as a custom color picker that can switch between palettes on demand. Download option
currently supports Lospec palettes.

# Instructions

Copy either the entire "addons" folder or the folder inside the "addons" folder from this project
into your own.

Addon will appear in the same dock as the inspector/node/history tabs. It will also override the
default editor inspector color-picker(except when editing resources. I'm working on getting that
working)

# Future

With the release of version 1.3, there are no hard update plans. Possible updates might include:
[ ] Theme integration of some sort
[ ] The ability to mass convert one color in the project to another

# Notes

Tested on Godot 4 (beta 16)
